# pyAPisolation
pyAPisolation isolates and extracts action potentials from ABF files (recorded in current clamp mode). The package is able to output feature arrays and/or raw current traces from the file(s). The module piggy backs off of some of the excellent work found in the pyABF package.
### Installation
To install run
  `pip install git+https://github.com/smestern/pyAPisolation`
